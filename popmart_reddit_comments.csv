This is the 4th store in the Houston area.

Huh?
"Pop Mart is a store that sells collectible vinyl figures in mystery boxes. The mystery boxes have chase and rare figures distributed randomly in them. Think about it like buying baseball cards and trying to pull a rookie autograph. It’s like that but with figurines. 

People are lining up for two reasons. 

1. They want to be able to buy the figures they like and get the hard to find figures at retail price. 

2. They are piece of shit resellers who are going to buy up as much as they can and then create an artificial scarcity situation where they can resell them for multiple times what they paid for them."
r/Consoom
what the fuck even is pop mart? this like a k-mart rip off?
"I don’t know what Pop Mart is, well other than the polarizing and somewhat troubled U2 tour from 1997 and 1998."
All that for something that will end up in a flea market or landfill in 10 years.
Does Pop Mart give away free cocaine or something? I'm not familiar with them.
I thought this had to do with pop tarts :(
Jeeebus on a raft. Idiocracy lives
mouth breathers
The fuck is a Pop Mart?
Wtf is popmart?
"We don’t deserve free healthcare. People will line up for this garbage, but not line up to vote."
For those out of the loop: Labubus
It's that serious huh?
Consumer culture. More trash to populate the planet.
What is a pop mart?
What the heck is Popmart?
"Wtf is Pop Mart, and why is it worth lining up for?

I suppose it is Texas, after all. Can't expect much out of there."
Ah. More cheap Chinese AI shit for the masses to consuuuume
"I had to google, hoping it was a store selling a wide variety of soda pops. So sad to be wrong."
"I thought from the name, it was a store that sells every imaginable kind of soda, but it looks like it's even dumber than that. So, they just sell overpriced collectible figurines? Why are people lining up like this?"
"People are stupid, and they love cheap junk."
The fuck is Pop Mart?
wtf is Popmart?
Waiting hours in line to buy dust collectors. Yay!
wtf is a pop mart.
MUST CONSUME
**consume**
Dang that's a lot of fat people. People line up and stand in line for hours for some plastic but don't have the motivation to protest democracy ending. Good stuff
Da fuck is a Pop Mart?

I know I'm an old fart but what is a Pop Mart?
More proof that America is stupid.
The next beanie baby trend for idiots.
"Had to google this place. Looks like a store of funkopop type collectibles and other items with characters on them. 

I don’t get it. I definitely don’t get standing in this long ass line for any of it."
Just looked it up. They seem more detailed and animated than those bland funko pops but still it gives off “beanie baby” vibes. In the long term probably won’t be worth a damn.
Brain rot merch
"Precious Moments sappy cuteness  
\+  
Funko Pops nostalgia  
\+  
Beanie Babies hype  
=  
Even more cheap crap that well fade into trash even faster."
This is such embarrassing behavior
![gif](giphy|3o85xxTgloA62RNuLu)
Send the asteroid
The anti-consumer in me hates this. Younger generations complain that their boomer parents have a house full of junk they don’t want yet they’re still gobbling up junk like this. Don’t get it.
Holy hell JCPenny is still a thing?!?
Looks like Precious Moments for geeks.
Holy fucking beanie babies Batman!
WTF is Pop Mart?
"They can line up for a store like this, but not to vote?  Treat your candidates like products and maybe you will see better results."
What is Pop Mart. I have google. But I want Redditors to answer.
"TIL that these people sell those little collectibles that everyone's grandma had made out of porcelain, ya know those really creepy ones that are like children with big eyes and rosey cheeks.

The difference NOW is they turned them little creeps into anime characters and it seems like we're gonna have 80 year olds with little creepy anime tchotchkes all over their apartments in 40 years."
Fuck is pop mart?
These people never watched the beanie baby documentary I’m guessing
![gif](giphy|3orif2UsQs04NEnEUE)
"Oh wow all the same stores as that other strip mall, let’s line up for hours."
"r/mildlybaddrivers

didn’t even stop at the stop sign"
"I’ve never heard of this item, but why on earth would you wait for that long. I can’t think of many things that would cause me to wait in that line"
Da fuk is a PopMart
"I will never understand people.  

2 years ago a 5 guys opened up in my tiny Midwestern town.  For 2 or 3 weeks straight the road had issues with being blocked because of the gigantic line of cars around the block.  

These people could not wait to pay 15 bucks for a mediocre fast food hamburger.  Why??"
America is gross.
What the fuck is Pop Mart?
![gif](giphy|s239QJIh56sRW|downsized)
American consumerism like this will always sicken me
"Huh there's been toys like that for forever in Asia, i guess they're just hitting here now."
"So simultaneously 60% of us can barely survive , but dipshits can line up for figurines?"
I thought the economy wasn’t doing so well
"Were they giving away big screen TVs or something because I don’t know why a new Walmart, who sells the same stuff as every other Walmart, would attract this kind of attention"
I am I the only  that's surprised there's a JCPenny open still?(calli)
"You got me with POGS, then it was Beanie Babies, I fell for NFTs, but this is where I am drawing the line…"
![gif](giphy|Cz6TlrRVVyv9S)
Idiots.
"Man, I used to work at a store in that mall when I was younger...that line is even more ridiculous when you know what it's like on foot."
As someone who works in a mall that just had one open ...no one can stop them from doing so and they will bitch when 90% of them get nothing
"This depressed the shit out of me. Jesus. 
Is that asteroid almost here, hopefully?"
This stuff is like 2 shades away from precious moments.
Wow. It’s just junk. Make something a hot item and everyone wants it. In 6 months will people care?
"Wtf is a popmart, and malls still exist?"
wt heck is pop mart?
Straight up did not stop at the clearly visible stop sign
The fuck is a Pop Mart?
"You ever notice how stuff like this, massive lines for collectibles, blind boxes, sneakers, whatever, always seems to spike when people are feeling economically boxed in?

I had an economics lecturer once say that rising interest in gambling often shows up right before societal upheaval. Sounded dramatic at the time, but there’s actually research behind it. Gambling, speculative investing, even blind-box toy hype, these are all behaviors that increase when people feel financially stuck or shut out of traditional success.

When people can’t afford housing, can’t get ahead with a “normal job,” and don’t trust institutions to help them, they start looking for high-risk, high-reward options, whether it’s crypto, lottery tickets, meme stocks, or collectible toys. It’s not just about money either, it’s about control, identity, and emotional escape.

Historically, we’ve seen this before:

France before the revolution: lottery craze.

Weimar Germany: gambling and speculation exploded during hyperinflation.

Late Imperial China: gambling dens everywhere.

It’s not that collectibles or toys are bad, they’re fun, and a lot of people genuinely enjoy them. But when you see huge crowds lining up in desperation or obsession, sometimes it’s a cultural signal that something deeper is off.

Not saying a revolution is around the corner, but it does make you think."
"Never heard of a pop mart until this video so I just had a scroll through the website and it's full of very tacky looking pointless nonsense sold under the guise of being ""collectable"".  Some people have way too much free cash and incredibly poor taste to find that stuff appealing."
We sure do like buying useless crap
wtf is pop mart
And people thought we were dumb collecting beanie babies...... So glad I saw how dumb that whole situation was so I'll never be into stuff like this
What the heck!  Never heard of this store
That’s a line for The Phantom Menace in 1999
Pokemon cards?
Those freaking dolls are fugly and weird! I don’t see the appeal at all. Fcker are close to $100 what in the world!!
I guess the world collective seems to be staying on its doomed trajectory.
Y'all remember beanie babies?
Lmao why do these remind me of those precious moments things boomers bought mixed with brats
What the hell is a pop mart?
I worked in this mall for 6 years who would volunteer to be here
P-o-k-e-m-o-n
labubu is such horseshit
"They have one opening in Orland Park (not sure when this year) and my sister wanted to go the day of… I said no, you’re crazy."
These people vote… terrifying..

"They look like a mix of funko and precious moments, quite the amalgamation"
So now you wait in line to get the toy from the 25 cent candy machine.  I'm so tired
And I thought my nephew’s obsession with LOL Surprise blind boxes was bad
I Never heard of pop mart. Can anyone tell me what it is?
People are so shallow. There is nothing a store is selling that is worth waiting hours in line for.
"Crazy gotta have people tell people to stand in a line, or they'll be standing in the street. Just happened this morning at a store, people just casually hanging out in the road waiting for it to open.

People, we learn to line up in kindergarten."
It’s crazy how there isn’t a long line from my computer chair to the internet for these things
What the actual F?
broooo it is not that serious lmao
These things are fucking hideous.
"A bunch of people hoping to make an easy buck, but it's just a bunch of shit that ends up in the ocean."
Weird seeing my childhood mall on here randomly
Because Instagram.
Now the people who broke the rules will be rewarded for their behavior since they got to get in first. I’m not sure what pop mart is or why you’d need to be tje first one in but I’m betting they do
People waiting to buy junk
This is what’s wrong with humanity. People obsessing over damn figurines.
Da fuk is a pop mart?
What’s pop mart?
"I first learned of this store a couple of weeks ago, when my bank emailed me about a credit card charge at a merchant known for fraudulent activity. Someone got my # and spent $150 at one in NYC"
Smoke a joint and wait it out.
Consume! Consume! Consume!
More pop shit
This is so lame
All i see is resellers
"The last time I saw a line like that around a building, George Lucas released '*Return of the Jedi*'

The year was 1983...."
"Wow these designs are UGLY. How do you fuck up chopper?

"Lu-Bullshit
At least with pokemon cards those have value. These are just plushies that get dirty"
What’s Pop Mart?
I kept reading pop tart and got excited thinking it was some crazy new brand pop up where they make custom pop tarts for you or something :(
It's just this generation's precious memories figures
"Never heard of Pop Mart had to google it 

""Pop Mart is a Chinese toy company 
The company is known for selling collectable 'designer' toys, often sold in a 'blind box' format""



A queue that size just to purchase a little figurine 😬"
Sorry um who said these were cool?
What is Popmart?
Wtf is a pop mart? Hahahaha I love not being on TikTok and loosely engaged on the internet other than here
"Based on the crowd, this is something that has no interest to me whatsoever."
How very sad
Serious overpopulation problem and oxygen thief problem in the world.
What is a pop mart?
Blew through that stop sign
Wow. It’s overpriced Chinese plastic. This is ridiculous.
What kind of mall only has 1 door?
"Ive not heard of these new pvc statues, so I had to look it up. It's a store that exclusively sell the equivalent of Hummel figurines for young millennials and gen Z? First Hummels, then  Beanie Babies, then Funko Pops, now these... every generation has one."
I wouldn’t even buy this stuff online with free shipping. Wtf?
Collecting things is awesome. Waiting for 5 hours because you saw it on TikTok is idiotic behavior.
What the fuck is a pop mart?
What the fuck are these things? They are like the millennial version of those little porcelain kids that my grandma collected.
"I think some of the figures are super cute but the price they charge and the fact that they're blind boxes makes me say no.  If I could just get the couple I wanted for $10 each then ok.

I'll have to keep my eyes open on eBay I guess."
The beanie babies of generation Z.
Gen Z Hummel figures
Is this real?
is this for those ugly creepy doll charms?
"Me in DFW working 2 jobs and overpaying for gas and groceries just to survive : 👁️👄👁️

No honestly, people can afford to stand in line for hours just to buy toys?"
Interesting type of people lol
"It’s crazy, cuz we’re supposed to be in this recession, and everyone is struggling, and here we have people lining up around blocks to buy dolls. Ffs."
WTF is a Pop Mart?
Did iCE show up?
"What the hell is PopMart?

I'm in Chicago and have never seen one"
Wtf is a pop mart?
Sometimes I feel these ppl are paid to line up outside the store to create a buzz.
"It's a toy store? What is happening.

Edit: why are the toys 2cm key chains cats and €99?"
Spirit Airlines
This makes me root for tariffs
Wait. This is a line for a store that sells little dolls?
There is absolutely nothing in any store that would make me stand in a line. I can sit at my house and wait or find it in a different store.
Funko pops are just this generation of beanie babies
I like labubus they’re cute. I got some before the hype took off in the US. But man I don’t like them anywhere near this much. This is pathetic.
The fuck is dat?
Ain’t no mf way …
How much time and disposable income do people really have?
"It’s like Beany Babies, but much slower to crash."
Had no idea what this was. Turns out it's blind boxes (read: gambling) for shitty little tchotchke/nik-nak figurines of dolls. So it's a fad hobby for stupid poor people to waste money on. Meh.
"![gif](giphy|l1J9uoPg0nK5o2Puw|downsized)

the items give me “monchichi “ vibes"
"Millennial and Gen-Z version of Precious Moments, I guess?? Terrifying."
Nasty.
What’s a pop mart? I’m out of the loop.
Baaaaa...
"Saw a long line (not as long as this) for a Pop Mart Vending Machine at Arrowhead Mall in Glendale.

ISTG I don’t know the hype."
That’s just sad.
"TIL about the modern day beanie baby. 

Where do kids get the money for this shit??"
i dont get it. We have a lot pop mart vending machines in stores and some stores in CA. They have some nice quality to them people doesn't really care much at the time I go to their stores.
Have they not heard of 3d printers? Anything that's plastic is pretty easy to make yourself now
More plastic please. That's what we need more plastic in everything. EVERYTHING.
labarfbarf 😂
JC Penny still around?
"People literally buying all this useless things for the hype. More junk, more plastic for the planet just imagine the amount of plastic that it's use to make this nonsense just more pollutants for the planet ,whatever happen to all these people beings eco-friendly,"
I did want one because they remind of the wild things book but I’m not willing to pay double for nostalgia
I am so glad I live in Europe where it’s so easy to go and pick these items up.
So many Labubu will end up in thrift stores like the many many fads before it.
"People! Hey! You hear me! Get Fucking Life!!! No better yet, get a HOBBY! This is ridiculously SAD!"
Did I just google the right thing?? Are those people standing in line for those Precious Moment/Funko Pop bastard looking things???
Our country is so cooked
What is Pop Mart?
Why do people do this? I don’t get it
Beanie baby vibes
does the video even show the end of the line?? lol should i have heard of this shit
What’s Pop Mart? We don’t have any where I live.
What’s a Pop Mart?
Since no one has heard of Pop Mart Ive made a executive decision and have decided that this is a psyop. Fake publicity drummed up like how Lil Nas X forced Old Town Road.
At least they all have their priorities straight! /s
"I really don’t understand how so many Americans are in a shit ton of debt, yet line up for so long just to to buy useless things like this. 

This really depresses me"
Damnit I had to google search this shyt. A Chinese company that designs and sells collectible designer toys.
People really want their plastic future garbage.
Freaks.
Texans have far too much money and time relative to their intellectual and moral capabilities which we all know are catastrophically bad. When the oil runs out they'll be a narco vassal state.
Beanie Babies 2.0
People are crazy. Idolize such worthless nonsense.
Is Texas ok?
Anything people can do to scalp and scam.
Everything about this is awful.
Nope! I could never. I would hate to work there. 😆
Looks like our Funko.
What are they queuing up for?
"""Snape kills Dumbledore!"""
Thanks for the clarification
I don’t get it. Someone help me understand. Is it limited edition pop art or something?
"Ah I used to work at baybrook mall way back when in 2000-2004. I miss those days. 

Mall defo isn’t the same. And this pop mart crap. Why?"
How can people waste money on this shit. $23 gamble for a small plush and you might get one you already have!?
Middle aged Midwestern male. Never heard of Pop Mart  until today. The malls around here are retail apocalypse. There hasn't been a line for anything since Thanksgiving 2013.
Late stage capitalism - perfect little consumers - kinda sad
I've never felt so old.
Amazing to see how people don't know about pop mart and The Monsters. It's a massive brand. They have theme parks around the world. Huge celebrity fans that endorse it. Goes to show mega popular things are out there you've never heard of
TIL what pop mart is.
r/consoom 
Oh god that poor kid at the end.
Wayyy too many adults.
For cheap plastic toys?  Am I high or are they?
Damn I used to steal from the Abercrombie and Bitch there
We’re all going to die
"Ma'am you just ran the stop sign.

Hell no"
Look at all those adult sized children LOL
What's a pop mart?
 What’s pop mart?
I was into popmart before it was cool... now it feels icky
Chinese crap.
"Logically, there's a limited amount of product in the store. Why would you line up after the first 100-150 people?  
Also why would you want to waste time just standing there, not knowing if you are going to get in?  
Are these people this bored? Or are they just not smart enough to realize they are standing there for nothing?"
What is pop mart and don’t these people have better things to do
"We are so cooked as a society. I bet 95% of these people are only buying these Chinese plastic toys as some sort of gambling investment, like Pokemon cards."
The are going to pay for the cost to build the store today.
I like popmarts but come on man… they are not that hard to get retail online or in random asian stores..
Wtf? Lol
Are they fucking nuts????  It is 100 out there!!!
Sad hype losers.
"We have a Pop Mart at our local mall. They've been there a while now and they still get lines out the door. I went in to the store on a Tuesday, just out of curiosity. There was no line."
Dumb shit to line up for
Ok 1. None of these people have work that day? 2. What could be in this store that they need so bad? i have never heard of this store.
I’m glad I don’t know what this is.
"![gif](giphy|l46CtOixugtSr5hfi)

I was confused. I thought it was this popmart 😂😂"
Huh?
I guess stop signs are optional there
People are bored af
Collecting for the sake of collecting is weird as fuck. Buying expensive junk that is made artificially scarce by the manufacturer purely to sit on a shelf or in a drawer just doesn’t make sense to me.
Good to see a mall getting some love
Ran a stop sign 🙄
Why would anyone respect this line once the doors open?
Are these like precious moments that ppl used to collect in the 90s?
The new Beanie Babies?
This is really pathetic behaviour but is she just angry that she's not early enough.
What the heck is pop mart. I have only ever stood in line for a great Rock Concert lol
Proof we are far from an actual recession. A mile long line of people waiting to waste money.
"The fuck is a popmart?

I'm not in the U.S,btw"
So is it a store where you like buy Pepsi?
Why do so many in that line look overweight? Is it a Texas thing? Good barbecue?
"Serious question, what even is there to do in Texas?"
What’s pop mart? Like a bevmo?
Pops is our generation's beanie babies and cabbage patch kids.
Is Popmart the new GameStop?
This is just gambling. But you get useless junk.
Do they sell Pokémon cards now or something?
It would be funny if they said they weren't going to open because all the employees said fuck this. I'm out
But why lol is this a tik tok thing?
"Before opening the door, the employees should go down the line and let people who have kids present with them get first serve. And 2 per customer. I understand they shouldn't *have* to do that but it would be a good idea."
"That’s crazy we opened one in Vegas and it wasn’t THIS bad, it looked crazy but nothing like this"
Yikes
Invest your life savings. Quick.
Pop Mart. More like Cult Mart
"They’ve been open for years in shanghai and always busy. I’ve purchased “Molly” for 14 year old daughter of a friend and she loved it. 

Thought this was an Asian thing though. Show that Asian soft power is getting stronger."
And how many of these douchebags are just going to turn around and resell with a mark up on Ebay or marketplace?
Scalpers everyone of them.
99% scalpers
NPC’s as far as I can see.
If you wonder why we have inflation looking no further.
We have one here in San Diego and that store is super tiny for how busy it is.
[removed]
Is this not insane? For some lil furry thing thatl be cheaper in months like cmon
Grown adults getting a toy that does nothing
these people are kinda dum thinking they all can get one after seeing that many people I'd just leave
wait why are ppl doing this
Be so for real
"If only ppl faught like this for human rights, and the dictatorship that happening in the White House? This makes me lose hope in humanity."
how can they possibly serve all them people  no way
"wait, wasn't it just a few short months ago, this was happening ing for a Stanley cup?"
theye gonna start grabbing the ones off of people bags
"Don get me wrong, I really want one too. But this is INSANE?."
These are grown adults lol
and i guarantee more then half of them are resellers
"labubu or whatever it's called is childish and tacky, like Disney adults with Mickey mouse purses"
If only people rushed to church like this
don't you ppl have jobs??? We are doomed
The fact that half those people don even realize they don going to get one
What are they trying to get? The internet causes chaos
This is why I glad I get my labubus from my seller this is insane lol
STOP BUYING FROM RESELLERS AND THIS WILL STOP!!!
Yup this sucked I walked and everyone ran course
Grown adults
Sounds like pop mart is stopping labubu releases slowly because how bad it getting  they banned in the UK already
anyone ever seen the movie They Live? if you didn't go watch it and makes a whole Lotta sense nowadays
After seeing the first hundred people people don give up? Not saying it to be rude. But after the first fifty people I just assume I wasn getting anything.
just got to be quicker than the bots only way il get in a line is if store pickup
Our malls in Mexico are actulla always filled with people but not for a toy lol.. And we have SEARS
I hope they never change the flooring at stonestown. It’s so nostalgic for so many of us
Were they doing a giveaway? Why is this so popular?
Precious Moments for Millennials and GenZ
"“Sf is dying. We need to do stuff to revive it!”

“Wow this is stupid. So many people in line for something I don’t care about / understand” 

Gotta love it."
Stonestown has been so smart with the businesses they’re bringing in.
Lots of miserable people in this sub lol
"Redditors proving once again they have a superiority complex, insulting people’s innocent fun and holding it to be passé or unrefined. Modern day aristocratic arrogance disguised as social justice."
"People love figurines and miniatures. I don’t know what it is in us. 

I’m not a figurine fan, but I’ve always enjoyed, models and miniature worlds, dioramas. 
Gardening has that aspect as well.

Never heard of this place before but looks fun."
Oh this is what that line was for. I saw the line and figured it was for a Saturday morning shoe drop. That’s cool. Will have to check out the store.
I was visiting a friends family in china earlier this year and they had these in every mall we visited. They had some pretty cool figures.
Line was longer than this. It stretched from the entrance all the way to Whole Foods our front
"When I lived in China, I adored going to the PopMarts in the malls. This will be a nice store to go to at Stonestown."
"**Pop Mart is a company based in China** that primarily focuses on designing, developing, and selling pop toys. Their products are sold in China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and some other countries and regions."
What do they even sell? The caricatures looked creepy so I never went near the booth.
Oh THIS is what was happening. I was charging my car there late last night and saw a huge group of people camping out. Couldn’t image what it could be. The more you know!
finally!!!
I’m at San Diego Comic Con and this line isn’t any different for the Pop Mart booth here haha
Awesome! I’ll stop by next time I’m there (which is a lot) lol If Stonestown opens a Nordstrom it would be the best mall ever
"Same line when they open in Valley Fair!  I was there Thursday and didn’t know they were having a soft opening.  Was able to browse a bit.

What are they selling?
Imma wait for a Bandai Hobby Store to open up here
Best mall in the bay area by far
Love stonestown. This is like Easter or Christmas waiting  in line to get a photo. Doesn’t bother you if you don’t have to go to whatever this is
Christ. More cheap crap made probably by slave labor in a distant country to gather dust in one’s apartment/home/car.
It’s just toys…. It’s a redesign of grandma creepy porcelain dolls.
"Looking for the one
But you know you’re somewhere else instead
You wanna be the song 
The song that you hear in your heaaaaaad"
Sometimes you gotta pop out... and show product
Out of curiosity why not go next week without a line? FOMO special stock?
Let’s go POP MART.
Doesn’t GameStop sell the same thing?
It's just a vending machine?
By drones for drones. 
Just another generic Asian store
Looks like it was safe to drive in SF for a bit today.
"Something shady happened, the store manager inputs how many units to sell for pickup. Also they don’t know what they receive in shipment until they actually receive it. There was a store manager in NYC who was recently let go due to selling to a known reseller, so they are cracking down on employees doing stuff like that"
"Tangram  PopMart employees are NOTORIOUS for scamming the system. I am so sorry this happened to you. I absoluelty believe this happened due to employee negligence or malicious intent. Look through some of reddit posts about Tangram Popmart. Also their Google Reviews, they do backdoor dealings with inventory. 

NYC and surrounding areas seem to have it bad. There's barely any restocking in ANYTHING and some store managers have been fired, people quitting  (cough cough WTC). I hope regional management is looking into this."
U have a case here tbh breach of contract. Once they sent that email of confirmation theyve entered a contract with u and especially after making a 4 hour journey that also breaches consumer laws
"That is so messed up. Tangram location is the worst, I feel like the workers themselves are resellers/scalpers. There are posts of them allowing a single person ""store pick up"" a truck load of labubus. I do not trust this location at all"
No wonder why I saw so many people carrying huge boxes of Zimomo today around the mall.
This was the appropriate time to Karen out.
i would crash out
"I waited in a line for about 8 hours with about 20 other people for a restock at the Roboshop run by that mall. Some of us kept calling or even went to the store to ask if they were going to restock and kept getting told yes. There was an issue with a reseller and mall management and Popmart which resulted in them not restocking the machine at all. A bunch of us angry customers went to the store to complain and express our frustration and all they could do is offer an apology. No compensation, no guaranteed stock access, discount code or anything. The apology didn't do jack for the loss of time, discomfort (standing all those hours) or energy. 

I have also heard that one of the employees serves as an insider for a known reseller."

Sorry that happened to you. My heart would sink after hearing that and driving 4 hours 😞
That’s messed up
That is horrible 🥺 I’m so sorry that happened to you!!
No way…
Argh that's so awful I'm sorry 😭
"This is really sketchy! Because of the rumors circulating amongst NYC collectors regarding this particular location, I never get my hopes up until I have my order in hand when I do store pick up. I actually got my IFY via store pickup there. I was lucky to be in the area, having lunch, when my order was ready to be picked up, so I went right away. As I was walking into the store, I saw a UPS delivery person carting in a huge shipment, some of which were obviously Zimomo's because they were in their original, labeled brown shipping boxes. When the sales associate scanned my pickup code, he seemed confused and went to retrieve my order. About 10 minutes later, he emerges with the signature, white Zimomo bag, so I was relieved. He then proceeds to ask me for my order confirmation again, and then begins questioning me on how I was able to score it, LOL He specifically asked me what time I was able to order it for store pick up. I didn't know what to make out of those random questions at that moment because I was just genuinely happy, but later thinking about it, I found it odd. I'm so sorry this happened to you! Don't give up! You will get him!"

For some more information never let big companies get away with things like this amazon almost tried doing the same thing to me til I told them im escalating the matter"
I bet they gave it to their friends and family or someone paid off a worker. I don’t trust Pop mart employees.
That’s suspicious! I hope you got your money back!
That happened to me too. 😭 but Pop Mart has horrible customer service so 🤷🏻‍♀️.  Sorry that happened to you. Super frustrating.
I hope you lawyer up and get your zimomo!!! Nothing less than that!
How disappointing. I’m sorry.
I would fight with everything I’ve got. They need to not sell if they don’t have the item. Or if they did over sell you need your money back and some compensation. Escalate because 4hrs is not something little at all!
that is so shady I'm sorry that happened to you
Terrible customer care. I hope you are at least offered a gift card.
Oh hell no! That is fucked up.
"i’m sorry this happened to u :(( but if the store is refusing to refund u, u can try to file a dispute with ur bank"
I’m in massachusetts also and got my Zimomo IFY on snkdrunk i got it really quick you should try that
I was in the Norwalk area this afternoon and the ‘I found you’ Labubu was in stock! The store was near empty around noon.
Can anyone tell me if I just need the QR code for pick? Do I need an ID?
As a fellow Bostonian I’ve always thought about doing this for the Connecticut store and this just made my mind up 😭 not even including the 4 hour ride back. Also… how do we not have a popmart but Connecticut does
Take back the value of your gas in their products.

It’s been a full week and Pop Mart has still not responded.

If this is how they handle confirmed orders + customer complaints, people need to know.

I’ll be updating this across platforms — this isn’t over."

Run them fades off the back
"This is all one person. These people have no shame it’s ridiculous. I thought you HAD to log into your account to show your code?? Lmk how she was scrolling through 50+ codes and picking up all the stock?? I came for one singular item and told the worker I’m not going to stand idly by while I watch this happen and to give me my shit. Unreal.

(Oh and the kicker is that she had more codes to scan after this photo was taken 😂)"
"Thankfully pop mart has been stocking much more, saturating market, hopefully it continues and resellers sit on their debt. Went to my store (California) and no one was buying macarons full set lolz. Whole wall full of it."
Don’t buy from scalpers people! Make them eat all this stock.
this is worse than the one I posted. YIKES
"Omg we were there! My husband and I saw her pull up and we went inside the store and the cashier told us she the lady had 50 plus 20 more pick ups, she said she basically was buying all the stock left up, my husband and I had our stuff but was crazy to see"
Pop Mart NEEDS to implement a “No Proxy” rule it should be one account per person and it has to be your account. EVERYTIME I pick up at my pop mart locations they ask me to log in to my account and I cannot use a screen shot. So those employees are just letting it happen.
"https://preview.redd.it/mngjz9pq5mje1.jpeg?width=807&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4bd1fac1999b27d2ba192afbd66155f92539d049

Found this on rednote. Someone selling for a ""good price"", based in Flushing."
Greed is working hard even on weekends
I can’t wait for the hype to die down on these like what’s happening with Squishmallows.
"I believe staff are helping people to get away with this. My friend recent experience at Popmart was also pretty bad.
She got into the store and spotted some SkullPanda - Winter Symphony plush, she had 2 boxes in her hands already, went up to register wanting to pay but was told by the store staff that she couldn’t buy it because there was a line outside of the store but when my friend got there, there was absolutely no line therefore she went in. So they refused to sell and told her to go out.
As soon as my friend left the store, she looked back and saw a group of people at the counter buying each a whole set! And these people weren’t even “in line”. 2 minutes later, the plush was “sold out” so everyone in line left disappointingly."
What location is this?
"Employees should only scan one per person and let those other accounts auto cancel after no show for pickup. But as long as they're making money, they're not gonna care."
"If you’re a collector, don’t sweat it. If you want to buy at SRP or less, BE VERY PATIENT. It may take weeks or months, but it will happen (unless it’s a hot item limited edition). 

1. These bulk scalpers will tend to panic when their inventory stockpiles and doesn’t appear to be selling. 
2. Pop Mart WILL RESTOCK. Again: BE PATIENT. It will happen!"
https://i.redd.it/4vxzpmeselje1.gif
that’s crazy! And I felt bad buying 5 boxes omg 😭
Definitely would have took a couple bags and ran
"That’s ridiculous! Why waste time to resell those? When I sell my dupes I just sell them for what I paid for or trade it for what I need. I don’t even buy from those overpriced resellers, I rather wait till I can get them from the website or at the store 🤦🏻‍♀️."
"This is horrible.. I encourage you to post this photo on their google review page, hopefully POPMART does something about this."
Hmm maybe report it to PopMart? Im not sure they can do anything but its not fair if the workers are letting people they know do this. Bc like you said realistically how do they have 50+ codes??? Something is fishy there….
"Damn! 👀👀

Anyways, Anybody know how I could score any labubus in tangram? Why do i feel like other people get first dibs??"
Thank you all for letting me know this is at Tangram! Was planning on stopping by there during my NY trip but looks like I am going to steer clear of that place!
"At the end of the day popmart is a company selling a product for profit. If this helps them get quick sales, even if we complain, I don’t expect them to do anything to control it :/"
I’ve become a reseller of sorts but I don’t buy this much stock!!  I maybe buy 1 box here or there but for that much stock good luck unloading it!!  This hobby is volatile and could be over in seconds.
The way I would have grabbed a bag and RAN
I thought you’re only allowed a certain amount?
"That location never checks for actual login. When I got my stuff at other locations, the staff always asked to click ""x"" to close out the QR code window and reopen it to prove it is the actual website. But at the Tangram location, they don't do that and an image of the QR code is enough for pickup."
Absolutely disgusting despicable behaviour!!!
I hope they resell at a loss
STOP BUYING FROM RESELLERS PEOPLE!!! it keeps fueling this.
Yep it’s people like this woman that nobody can get there hands on new releases with the popmart official site.
Smh....How?!?!
How?!!
They should stop this from happening.
This is crazy. They should at least make them line up again and let other people get their stuff.
What kind of bots are these people using? It's physically impossible to even click the checkout button in the time for stock to say sold out once it hits 6:00pm
$$$
"Not surprised in regards to Tangram, at the same time who is buying all the AIC?? It sits on the store pick up for a while"
"Gross, not mad I stopped collecting popmart."
This is what makes me not want to buy from them no more
"girl i would take a bag, cause this is RIDICULOUS"
Imma need yall to just grabbing and runing 💀/jk....unless 👀
That’s a bot for sure.. they make multiple accounts and then buy all the stock. The staff has no choice but to allow you to sign in to each account and scan every code. It doesn’t work off screen shot so she had to sign into like 50 accounts to do that
That is beyond uncalled for. not allowing others to have any. that woman is no doubt  a reseller. still though this isn’t right
"Scalping is loser behavior, forever and always."
i thought Popmart already have strict rules regarding scalpers? 
I don鈥檛 understand the hype over little plastic toys from China.
This is what people were making line for鈦?and the resellers r gonna ruin it for us
This is what that long ahh line was for?!?
THAT line for a McDonald鈥檚 happy meal toy store?!
The things people buy 馃う鈥?Capitalism will be the unaliving of us all 馃ゴ
this was very underwhelming
I don鈥檛 get it
so after the craze wears off what are people doing with these things?
I saw a long line on another TikTok鈥?this is where they鈥檙e going?
"Yep I鈥檓 old, I don鈥檛 get it"
that line was for THIS ?!? THAT'S MADNESS
It鈥檚 like beanie babies all over again
Oh people will go crazy for the labubus!!!
Could u buy a labubu right away?
Are you kidding me. 馃え
But it鈥檚 not a problem over consoles ?
Anyone come from the other video of the line to see what the hype was all about? I鈥檓 honestly disappointed.
Is this a children鈥檚 store??
what are those things?
oh
Period queen!!!
Love to see it!!
this what yall stood in that long line for??馃え馃え馃え
It was amazing !
as silly as this might be... remember people lining up for beanie babies and cabbage patch dolls? can't shame this generation when the past few have done the same
wow this is it?????? 馃う
Yassssss friend 馃グ
Just left the mall about two hours ago! They were all sold out of the labubus!
It鈥檚 been an open. Was there at the beginning of the week
am i too old or too young
"Yeah, no"
man I thought it was gonna be something cool. This is a disappointing reveal of what they waited in line for
So nice meeting you! Love the video
"Yeah, that is so not worth standing in a line"
So I went before the grand opening lol
Looks like something I would wait HOURS in line for
How fun 馃グ love this for you queen
That鈥檚 could of waited til the next day
"Some people really suck :(

That fake is horrendous. Its pupils are fully dilated."
gorl local mall stalls are like notorious for being fake 😭 go get your money back PLS
why does she have jaundice
I got a fake from my local mall as well :( it looks pretty cursed too.
"Eyes are like ""Mother... mother I crave violence"""
Go ahead sis. Which mall? Let’s put him on blast
It’s so scary
The black eyes are terrifying me right now ngl..
"Just a question, but can't you sue or something if they are selling fake products and saying they are authentic. Like it would need to be disclosed if they are fakes/knockoffs otherwise it's false advertising"

Honestly I’m surprised so many of these are still being sold. When I ask if they’re real the little kiosk owners in the mall either say they don’t know or straight up admit they’re fake. The fact that this dude told you it was real is the problem - it’s clearly fake and he should turn around and put away the rest of his investors but I bet he didn’t do that.

Call one of these numbers and report him. Nothing might happen or the next big news story is gonna be a crackdown on the fakes and they’ll be even more rare than the real ones 😂"
Looks like he’s gonna eat your soul!! 😭
I need to post a photo of the monstrosity I was sold a few weeks ago 😂 I mean my daughter loves it but I’m pissed I’m out 20 bucks
This is frightening. Fake labubus are really nightmare.
Omg !!!' :(
"Same, but idk why mine is kinda cute 😭"
Same thing with me lol. Got my gf one and it looks just like this one but it’s the green one. But she’s happy with it. It’s hard to find real ones since they’re always sold out it seems. Imo it’s just a stuffed animal. If you like it then you didn’t waste money. People comparing fake to real on a stuffed animal is just kinda weird anyways. It’s literally just stuffed animal
[deleted]
Bless that fake Labubu’s heart 🥺
How much did you pay for it and what’s the name of the store?
Worst lapupu I’ve ever seen. 😖
"I was sold a fake at a nearby mall, but it was a tokyo lifestyle and after showing them the proof I got refunded because it's illegal to sell counterfeit merchandise"
That Lapoopoo looks really albino I would straight up rip the head off and set it on fire that things creepy as hell. Then I would go back to the store and make the guy that sold you it watch it I wonder how his face will look then. He will probably be in shock that you went that far he will I’m sure start feeling guilty about it all. Maybe he will learn his lesson then and tell people they are fakes not real ones.
"Honestly I can top this, mine has like a whole crooked face and his head spins all the way around and is super loose :("
I kinda like him tho 😭
No way they even had enough product to support everyone waiting lol
I was there yesterday and there was no line鈥?I had no idea what Pop Mart even was until I just looked it up. These people just waited in line for hours for what I can tell is not even cute stuff. Kinda like the Trader Joe鈥檚 mini totes 馃檮
"for people saying it wasn鈥檛 worth it, for a lot of people that was in the line it was, i got there at 6 in the morning i was number 239 and i got a whole box"
What day was this?
this is what I was NOT going to do today 馃槀馃槀馃槀 everyone has too much patience!
Little did they know that a store on the other side of the hall had them stocked big time with no line lmao. Walked in and got all my kids and me one and this was 5pm today
There鈥檚 no way I鈥檇 even stand behind 1/4 of that line! Lol
We were there today and that line was WILD!
What time was this we went at noon and line was crazy!
Stop buying from resellers. Let them be stuck with them.
"Bro couldn鈥檛 even afford it, had to use his girls card"
Yea I'll wait  i never bought from resellers in my life
How they skip everyone waiting?
are they restocking everyday?
Brokie couldn鈥檛 even afford it had the chick pay 
Lil P energy
EVERYONE STOP BEING FROM OVER PRICED RESELLERS AND THEY WILL STOP IVER BUYING
it鈥檚 literally the resellers who ruin everything.
Yessss finally but like pop mart really needs to start putting limits in the vending machines like they have they in stores
Aint no one gonna buy from him 
I went to one in Cali and they had an employee that only let u buy one per person. This is crazy
I don鈥檛 understand why people are so greedy
This is the most I鈥檝e ever seen the dolphin mall on my feed 
We need stores in Miami
And this is why we need too ban the unemployed from using credit cards banks shouldn鈥檛 allow it to go through if your not registered employed so we can stop scalpers
ik this mall anywhere this the dolphin mall!
How many did he buy ?
"Time IS money! You may never get one on popmart, but I bit the bullet and bought from them and got the exact one I wanted without the stress or waiting in ques. TBH, worth the extra money"
Never EVER buy from resellers. Let them be stuck with them and their sneakers bwahahaaa
