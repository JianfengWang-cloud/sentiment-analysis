"This is really sketchy! Because of the rumors circulating amongst NYC collectors regarding this particular location, I never get my hopes up until I have my order in hand when I do store pick up. I actually got my IFY via store pickup there. I was lucky to be in the area, having lunch, when my order was ready to be picked up, so I went right away. As I was walking into the store, I saw a UPS delivery person carting in a huge shipment, some of which were obviously Zimomo's because they were in their original, labeled brown shipping boxes. When the sales associate scanned my pickup code, he seemed confused and went to retrieve my order. About positive0 minutes later, he emerges with the signature, white Zimomo bag, so I was relieved. He then proceeds to ask me for my order confirmation again, and then begins questioning me on how I was able to score it, LOL He specifically asked me what time I was able to order it for store pick up. I didn't know what to make out of those random questions at that moment because I was just genuinely happy, but later thinking about it, I found it odd. I'm so sorry this happened to you! Don't give up! You will get him!",reddit,negative
