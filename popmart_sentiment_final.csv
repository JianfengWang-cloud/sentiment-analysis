"Pop Mart is a store that sells collectible vinyl figures in mystery boxes. The mystery boxes have chase and rare figures distributed randomly in them. Think about it like buying baseball cards and trying to pull a rookie autograph. It’s like that but with figurines. 

People are lining up for two reasons. 

1. They want to be able to buy the figures they like and get the hard to find figures at retail price. 

2. They are piece of shit resellers who are going to buy up as much as they can and then create an artificial scarcity situation where they can resell them for multiple times what they paid for them.",reddit,negative

"You ever notice how stuff like this, massive lines for collectibles, blind boxes, sneakers, whatever, always seems to spike when people are feeling economically boxed in?

I had an economics lecturer once say that rising interest in gambling often shows up right before societal upheaval. Sounded dramatic at the time, but there’s actually research behind it. Gambling, speculative investing, even blind-box toy hype, these are all behaviors that increase when people feel financially stuck or shut out of traditional success.

When people can’t afford housing, can’t get ahead with a “normal job,” and don’t trust institutions to help them, they start looking for high-risk, high-reward options, whether it’s crypto, lottery tickets, meme stocks, or collectible toys. It’s not just about money either, it’s about control, identity, and emotional escape.

Historically, we’ve seen this before:

France before the revolution: lottery craze.

Weimar Germany: gambling and speculation exploded during hyperinflation.

Late Imperial China: gambling dens everywhere.

It’s not that collectibles or toys are bad, they’re fun, and a lot of people genuinely enjoy them. But when you see huge crowds lining up in desperation or obsession, sometimes it’s a cultural signal that something deeper is off.

Not saying a revolution is around the corner, but it does make you think.",reddit,negative

As I was walking into the store, I saw a UPS delivery person carting in a huge shipment, some of which were obviously Zimomo's because they were in their original, labeled brown shipping boxes. When the sales associate scanned my pickup code, he seemed confused and went to retrieve my order. About 10 minutes later, he emerges with the signature, white Zimomo bag, so I was relieved. He then proceeds to ask me for my order confirmation again, and then begins questioning me on how I was able to score it, LOL He specifically asked me what time I was able to order it for store pick up. I didn't know what to make out of those random questions at that moment because I was just genuinely happy, but later thinking about it, I found it odd. I'm so sorry this happened to you!

Honestly I’m surprised so many of these are still being sold. When I ask if they’re real the little kiosk owners in the mall either say they don’t know or straight up admit they’re fake. The fact that this dude told you it was real is the problem - it’s clearly fake and he should turn around and put away the rest of his investors but I bet he didn’t do that.
