1. They want to be able to buy the figures they like and get the hard to find figures at retail price.

"You ever notice how stuff like this, massive lines for collectibles, blind boxes, sneakers, whatever, always seems to spike when people are feeling economically boxed in?

I had an economics lecturer once say that rising interest in gambling often shows up right before societal upheaval. Sounded dramatic at the time, but there’s actually research behind it. Gambling, speculative investing, even blind-box toy hype, these are all behaviors that increase when people feel financially stuck or shut out of traditional success.

When people can’t afford housing, can’t get ahead with a “normal job,” and don’t trust institutions to help them, they start looking for high-risk, high-reward options, whether it’s crypto, lottery tickets, meme stocks, or collectible toys. It’s not just about money either, it’s about control, identity, and emotional escape.

Historically, we’ve seen this before:

France before the revolution: lottery craze.

Weimar Germany: gambling and speculation exploded during hyperinflation.

Late Imperial China: gambling dens everywhere.

It’s not that collectibles or toys are bad, they’re fun, and a lot of people genuinely enjoy them. But when you see huge crowds lining up in desperation or obsession, sometimes it’s a cultural signal that something deeper is off.

Not saying a revolution is around the corner, but it does make you think.",you ever notice how stuff like this massive lines for collectibles blind boxes sneakers whatever always seems to spike when people are feeling economically boxed in i had an economics lecturer once say that rising interest in gambling often shows up right before societal upheaval sounded dramatic at the time but there s actually research behind it gambling speculative investing even blind box toy hype these are all behaviors that increase when people feel financially stuck or shut out of traditional success when people can t afford housing can t get ahead with a normal job and don t trust institutions to help them they start looking for high risk high reward options whether it s crypto lottery tickets meme stocks or collectible toys it s not just about money either it s about control identity and emotional escape historically we ve seen this before france before the revolution lottery craze weimar germany gambling and speculation exploded during hyperinflation late imperial china gambling dens everywhere it s not that collectibles or toys are bad they re fun and a lot of people genuinely enjoy them but when you see huge crowds lining up in desperation or obsession sometimes it s a cultural signal that something deeper is off not saying a revolution is around the corner but it does make you think,2,negative,reddit

A bunch of us angry customers went to the store to complain and express our frustration and all they could do is offer an apology. No compensation, no guaranteed stock access, discount code or anything. The apology didn't do jack for the loss of time, discomfort (standing all those hours) or energy.

"This is really sketchy! Because of the rumors circulating amongst NYC collectors regarding this particular location, I never get my hopes up until I have my order in hand when I do store pick up. I actually got my IFY via store pickup there. I was lucky to be in the area, having lunch, when my order was ready to be picked up, so I went right away. As I was walking into the store, I saw a UPS delivery person carting in a huge shipment, some of which were obviously Zimomo's because they were in their original, labeled brown shipping boxes. When the sales associate scanned my pickup code, he seemed confused and went to retrieve my order. About 10 minutes later, he emerges with the signature, white Zimomo bag, so I was relieved. He then proceeds to ask me for my order confirmation again, and then begins questioning me on how I was able to score it, LOL He specifically asked me what time I was able to order it for store pick up. I didn't know what to make out of those random questions at that moment because I was just genuinely happy, but later thinking about it, I found it odd. I'm so sorry this happened to you!
